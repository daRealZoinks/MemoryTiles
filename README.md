# MemoryTiles

Homework game made in WPF C#.
The classic game where you need to make pairs of cards.

It has music I made on the train, the weirdest images I could find online (the teacher was speechless) and ugly UI.

⚠️ Warning ⚠️:
I didn't know how to create post-build actions. Soooooooooooooo... after you build the game from source, add the [asset](MemoryTiles/assets) folder to the build folder. Please. `MemoryTiles\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows`
